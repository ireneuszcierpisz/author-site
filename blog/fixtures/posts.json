The Oracle replied, Agis has left because of human reasons. For his clan and for his ambitions he betrayed the Principles. He wants to take care of his own people at the cost of other families. All the clans lived in harmony for ages, she continued, raising her voice and looking around at the gathered people. We worked and built together, we mixed blood in accordance with the Principles. We did not grow in strength by causing misery and unhappiness to our relatives and neighbours. What god worth praying for would like to divide his people and sew hatred into their hearts ?!</p>",

This world offers a certain wildness, contact with nature and people who are unpolluted by technology and civilization for whom Mother Earth is a goddess, and the Principles guarantee order.</p>",

Maybe "time travel "is an exaggeration but MayaVR can create a world that almost perfectly imitates Crete in 1627 BC on the basis of archaeological data. Ben can experience himself how realistic this game is. The problem is not only the additional, authorized access of other participants, but also the unauthorized access of intruders who were never meant to appear in the system. In the time when Artificial Intelligence was created, violence could be born from a small grain of chaos and in ancient times when existing rules ceased to be important violence became the main currency.</p>",
